            <p>Word embeddings encode a lot of semantic as well as syntactic features and therefore are useful in many
                tasks,
                especially in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval.
                To exhibit the rich information stored in word embeddings and utilize it for use cases in relational
                database
                systems we propose FREDDY (Fast woRd EmbedDings Database sYstems) an extended relational database system
                based on
                PostgreSQL.
                We introduce a wide range of UDFs forming the base for novel query types allowing the user to analyze
                structured
                knowledge in the database relations together with huge, unstructured text corpora encoded as word
                embeddings.
                Supported by different index structures and approximation techniques these operations are able to
                perform
                fast
                similarity computations on high-dimensional vector spaces.
                A web application makes it possible to explore these novel query capabilities on different database
                schemes
                and a
                variety of word embeddings generated on different text corpora.
                From a systems perspective the user is able to examine the impact of multiple approximation techniques
                and
                their
                parameters for similarity search on query execution time and precision.
